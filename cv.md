### Profile {#profile}

Senior Software Engineer with eight years of experience in the industry. As the first technical hire for an ambitious kiwi startup, I have spent the last two years designing, building and delivering a successful SAAS product to market. Prior experience in a much larger organisation provides excellent grounding as a technical manager and mentor, who has vast experience fixing urgent production issues.

Programming Teacher
: *Sydney Programming School (code4fun)*
__Sep 2016 - Mar 2017__
Code4Fun are a commercial programming school in Sydney, Australia. As part of the teaching team I taught most afternoons and on occasional holiday camps.<br><br>
Teaching classes and preparing courses provided a different take on patience and communication that I have since found useful professionally. Moreover, teaching to a student who has no grounding in a subject truly enforces your own knowledge of the fundamentals.<br><br>
~ Teach programming to students aged 6-16 in groups of up to 22<br>
~ Create and teach syllabi for Angular 2 ([WhatsApp clone](https://github.com/lathonez/powwow)) and Python ([Aboriginal Translation Portal](https://github.com/lathonez/wangka))<br>

Senior Problem Analyst (Tier III Support)
: *OpenBet*
__Jun 2013 - Dec 2013__
The time I spent with the support team serves me daily. I learned why best practices should be adhered to, why concise yet thorough processes are crucial, how to write effective documentation, how to find bugs quickly - and not cause them in the first place.<br><br>
Most of all I gained the skills required to perform complex tasks quickly and under intense pressure.<br><br>
~ Field urgent technical support escalations<br>
~ Perform diligent triage of incoming issues<br>
~ Analyse full stack performance<br>
